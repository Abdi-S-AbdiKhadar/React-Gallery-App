# React Gallery App

## Project Description
An app for React Gallery App

## Tools Used:

* UI Development: Build gallery components using JS and JSX.
* Routing: Set up navigation for search and topic pages with React Router.
* Data Fetching: Connect the Pixabay API using the Fetch API.

## Project Features:
> Building on the popularity of the React library, I have developed a modern image gallery application. By leveraging this "MVC" (Model, View, Controller) framework, I have  created a fast, modular single-page app that aligns with the latest industry standards. I have explored react best practices using JSX to write HTML-like code directly in my scripts. I have also experienced in essential tools like the Vite build tool and React Router for navigation..
